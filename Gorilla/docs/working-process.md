# Ways of working

## Project management
* "Todo" is uassigned work.
* "In Progress" is for issues that are being worked on. These should be assigned.
* "Done" for issues that are done.

## Change process
1. Create branch based of main for solving the GitHub issue at hand.
2. Implement code changes.
3. Create PR and link to issue by adding "#xx"
4. Have another person review it.
5. Reviewer should understand and have tested the code before approving.
6. Merge PR using "squash commits" option.

## Commit guidelines
* Keep commits small and concise.
* Try to have on change per PR working on 2 separate issues should be 2 seperate PRs.
* No reverts.
* If the branch has not been merged with main for a long time, then do a local merge before making a PR.
* If broadly spanding changes are required this needs to be aligned with the rest of the team.
